# webPage
Mock guitar store used to demonstrate abilities in Python, SQL databases, and web site design

README

Created as final project for CS108 by Sam Foreman.

The project involves creating a web page using HTML embedded in Python, and using database
tables created with MySQL. Note that the webpage & database no longer exist. A video showing
the website and its functionality can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3kX6kXAmH0

The website is a fake guitar store that allows users to buy and sell guitars listed on a database.
The user can also add funds to their account, and custom add a new guitar to the store.

Note that CSS was not allowed for the project - all website design was programming in HTMl.
